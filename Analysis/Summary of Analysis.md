The telecom industry is fiercely competitive, with customers frequently switching providers for better pricing, service quality, or features. The clientâ€™s dataset reveals a **churn rate of 26.86%**, significantly higher than the industry average of 15-20%. Key insights highlight that **California has the highest churn rate at 63.24%**, driven by intense competition and high customer expectations, despite its low customer base. The **top reasons for churn** are predominantly competitor-related, including better offers, superior devices, and faster download speeds, alongside poor customer service experiences. Additionally, **older customers (60+ years)** exhibit a high and increasing churn rate, often due to complex products, inadequate support, or natural reasons like relocation.

To address these challenges, the analysis recommends **enhancing competitive offerings** through tiered pricing, loyalty programs, and upgraded devices, as well as **improving network infrastructure** to match competitor speeds. **Customer service improvements** are critical, including empathy training for support executives, reducing call volumes through self-service options, and resolving issues proactively. For **older customers**, simplifying products, offering senior-friendly devices, and providing dedicated support can significantly improve retention. Leveraging **technology and analytics**, such as AI-powered chatbots and predictive analytics, will further enhance customer experience and identify at-risk customers.
