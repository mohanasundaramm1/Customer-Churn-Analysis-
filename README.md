Analyzing Customer Churn Data in Telecom Industry using Power BI

### **Problem Statement**

**Title:** *Analyzing Customer Churn to Improve Retention Strategies*

**Background:**
Customer churn is a critical metric for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. In this project, we aim to analyze customer churn data to identify patterns, root causes, and actionable insights that can help reduce churn rates and improve customer retention.

**Problem:**
The company is experiencing a high customer churn rate, which is negatively impacting revenue and customer loyalty. Initial analysis reveals that churn rates vary significantly across different states, age groups, and customer service interactions. Additionally, specific reasons for churn, such as poor service quality or lack of engagement, have been identified. However, there is no centralized, data-driven approach to understanding and addressing these issues.

**Objectives:**
1. Identify the states with the highest churn rates and analyze regional trends.
2. Understand the primary reasons for customer churn and their impact on retention.
3. Explore the relationship between customer age and churn rates.
4. Investigate the correlation between the average number of customer service calls and churn rates.
5. Provide actionable recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

**Key Questions:**
- Which states have the highest churn rates, and what factors contribute to this trend?
- What are the most common reasons customers leave, and how can they be addressed?
- Is there a specific age group that is more likely to churn, and why?
- Does the frequency of customer service calls indicate dissatisfaction or other issues?
- How can the company use these insights to implement targeted retention strategies?

**Expected Outcomes:**
- A comprehensive Power BI dashboard visualizing churn rates by state, age, and customer service interactions.
- Insights into the root causes of churn and actionable recommendations to address them.
- Improved customer retention strategies tailored to specific regions, age groups, and service-related issues.
